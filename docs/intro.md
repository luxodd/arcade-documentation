# Onboard your Game

Welcome developers to Luxodd! We're thrilled you're considering bringing your creative vision to our unique arcade platform. Our goal is to forge a strong partnership, offering players engaging experiences centered around skill and our innovative "strategic betting" system â€“ where players wager on their own abilities, not just chance. This guide outlines the journey your game will take from your development environment to being playable on Luxodd arcade cabinets across various locations.

## Your Game's Path to Production

Getting your game onto the Luxodd platform involves a clear, structured process designed for quality and smooth integration. Below, we detail the steps involved, from initial signup to seeing your game live on merchant arcades.

2. Integrate the API into your game (see [Arcade Launch Overview](/docs/arcade-launch/unity-plugin/overview) for detailed integration steps)

### Phase 3: Add a game that's ready for Luxodd

2. Click the Games drop down from the menu, then click `List`
3. Click to `edit` your game
4. Fill in the rest of the missing game information **Image URL, Game File, Video ID, Price, Status** and **Mission**
5. Developer ensures the following [checks](link to checks)
6. Once checks have been passed, the developer can toggle their game to the _Review_ state
7. Luxodd reviews the game. If approved then the status will change to _Approved_.
- If rejected the games stays will change to _Rejected_. A custom email with the reason will be sent back to developer. Developer will then fix the issues (start back at step 2).
- If approved game will be moved to the _Approved_ state by a Luxodd admin and an automated email will be sent to notify you of the approval.
8. At this point the game will be advertised to merchants to deploy in phase 4.


### Phase 4: Going Live

1. Upon successful validation, your game is deployed to our Production Environment
2. The game is added to the Luxodd Games Merchant Catalog
3. Arcade operators (Merchants) can now select your game for their venues
4. When a Merchant chooses your game, it's automatically deployed to their specific Luxodd arcade cabinet(s)
5. Your game is now live and accessible to players in that Merchant's location!
  - If this was the first time your game has been selected by a merchant, your game transistions from the _Approved_ to _Live_ state.


# Revenue Share

Players will be compensated based on what merchants pay them to deploy to their arcade, and are compensated for 10% of each session played.

Several other revenue strategies we have in development are outlined in our revenue [playbook](needs a link).
