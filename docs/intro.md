# Onboard your Game

Welcome developers to Luxodd! We're thrilled you're considering bringing your creative vision to our unique arcade platform. Our goal is to forge a strong partnership, offering players engaging experiences centered around skill and our innovative "strategic betting" system â€“ where players wager on their own abilities, not just chance. This guide outlines the journey your game will take from your development environment to being playable on Luxodd arcade cabinets across various locations.

## Your Game's Path to Production

Getting your game onto the Luxodd platform involves a clear, structured process designed for quality and smooth integration. Below, we detail the steps involved, from initial signup to seeing your game live on merchant arcades.

### Phase 1: How to onboard a game dev to Luxodd

:::note
Below steps can be skipped if you already have access to Luxodd Game Dev Portal.
:::

1. Create an account on [Luxodd](https://app.luxodd.com/registration?redirect=/home)
2. Click on the link (link somewhere on landing page) that will open a google form, fill out the form to get access to Luxodd portal
3. Once we verify the game developer (by reviewing game developer info). We send an acknowledgement email to the developer for both accepted and rejected cases
4. If we accepted the developer to be part of Luxodd game developer, then the developer can login to Luxodd portal with the same credentials as [Luxodd](https://app.luxodd.com/registration?redirect=/home)

### Phase 2: How to add games to Luxodd

1. Developer login to Luxodd portal
2. Get the API key (this API key is used in unity-plugin so that developer can update and verify the game compatibility that follows Luxodd game integration guidelines)
3. Provide game information like name, posters etc, along with a game zip file
4. As soon as the game is uploaded, its status will automatically move to _Review_ state
5. In the review process if the game passes all the checks. Then the status changed to _Approved_ state
6. There is another state of the game which is _Live_ state. This means the game is published and is currently used by Luxodd and the developer can track their earnings

### Phase 3: Game Integration and Testing

1. Download and integrate the Luxodd Arcade Plugin for Unity
2. Integrate the API into your game (see [Arcade Deployments](/docs/category/arcade-deployments) for detailed integration steps)
3. Test your game thoroughly in the staging environment:
   - Verify core gameplay
   - Test Luxodd API integrations (login, betting, metrics reporting)
   - Check performance and stability
   - Simulate player progression
   - Test strategic betting features extensively

### Phase 4: Review and Deployment

Once your game is ready for review:

1. Mark it as "Ready for Review" in the Developer Portal
2. Our team will conduct a thorough evaluation covering:
   - Technical Integration Accuracy
   - Performance and Stability
   - Content Guidelines Compliance
   - Strategic Betting Implementation
   - Overall Game Quality

:::note
If your game passes the review, it will be deployed to production. If issues are found, you'll receive detailed feedback for required changes.

### Phase 5: Going Live

1. Upon successful validation, your game is deployed to our Production Environment
2. The game is added to the Luxodd Games Catalog
3. Arcade operators (Merchants) can now select your game for their venues
4. When a Merchant chooses your game, it's automatically deployed to their specific Luxodd arcade cabinet(s)
5. Your game is now live and accessible to players in that Merchant's location!
