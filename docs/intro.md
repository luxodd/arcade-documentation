# DRAFT: Onboard your Game

Welcome developers to Luxodd! We're thrilled you're considering bringing your creative vision to our unique arcade platform. Our goal is to forge a strong partnership, offering players engaging experiences centered around skill and our innovative "strategic betting" system â€“ where players wager on their own abilities, not just chance. This guide outlines the journey your game will take from your development environment to being playable on Luxodd arcade cabinets across various locations.

## Your Game's Path to Production

Getting your game onto the Luxodd platform involves a clear, structured process designed for quality and smooth integration. Below, we detail the steps involved, from initial signup to seeing your game live on merchant arcades.

The path involves distinct phases for you, the developer, and our internal Luxodd team:

### Phase 1: How to onboard a game dev to Luxodd

:::note
Below steps can be skipped if the game developer already has access to Luxodd Game Dev Portal.
:::

1. Create an account on [Luxodd](https://app.luxodd.com/registration?redirect=/home)
2. Click on the link (link somewhere on landing page) that will open a google form, fill out the form to get access to Luxodd portal
3. Once we verify the game developer (by reviewing game developer info). We send an acknowledgement email to the developer for both accepted and rejected cases
4. If we accepted the developer to be part of Luxodd game developer, then the developer can login to Luxodd portal with the same credentials as [Luxodd](https://app.luxodd.com/registration?redirect=/home)

### Phase 2: How to add games to Luxodd

1. Developer login to Luxodd portal
2. Get the API key (this API key is used in unity-plugin so that developer can update and verify the game compatibility that follows Luxodd game integration guidelines)
3. Provide game information like name, posters etc, along with a game zip file
4. As soon as the game is uploaded, its status will automatically move to _Review_ state
5. In the review process if the game passes all the checks. Then the status changed to _Approved_ state
6. There is another state of the game which is _Live_ state. This means the game is published and is currently used by Luxodd and the developer can track their earnings
