# Arcade Compatibility Guide

## UI Requirements

Since your game is meant for arcade machines, make sure your UI is fully navigable using a joystick and six input buttons.

## Recommended Actions

### Input System

- Use Unity's Input System to map joystick directions and button presses
- Design large, clear UI elements suitable for physical controls
- Avoid requiring precise cursor movement or long text entry

### Example Project

For a practical reference, see how arcade interaction is handled in the included example project: [Ship Battle Game](../../example-arcade-shooter.md)
