# WebSocket API Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the WebSocket API commands available for Luxodd game integration. Use these commands to interact with the Luxodd platform from your game.

## Postman Collection

To help you test and understand these WebSocket commands, we've created a public Postman collection that you can use:

<PostmanButtonContainer>
	<PostmanButton url="https://www.postman.com/luxodd-team/luxodd-public-game-dev/collection/681886238c4b51f645ce9787/game-dev-collection?action=share&creator=44609532" />
</PostmanButtonContainer>

:::tip
Using the Postman collection is the fastest way to get familiar with our WebSocket API. You can see example requests and responses, and test the API directly without writing any code.
