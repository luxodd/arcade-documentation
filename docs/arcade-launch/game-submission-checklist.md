| 5   | **Arcade Game Conversion** | If the game was meant for a different platform, then all elements that are not supported by Luxodd need to be removed (i.e. in game ads (for now), vibration effects, special scoring components used for mobile (separate currencies for a non-Luxodd game marketplace)) |

## 2\. Session and Security

| No. | Requirement                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :-- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Session Token Handling**  | The game must validate and use session tokens passed by the arcade launcher                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2   | **Health Check Status**     | The game must check with the game server every 5 seconds. If 3 missed checks the server will automatically redirect the session back to the Luxodd game launch list of games.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3   | **Data Egress Validation**  | Luxodd whitelists all games from call non-Luxodd services.All external data calls must be declared and documented (URLs, endpoints, purpose). Email admin@luxodd.com with this information to build in external dependencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4   | **PIN Handling (if used)**  | PIN must be hashed (done automatically using the plugin command) The entry field must mask input. Only an off-screen keypad allowed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5   | **Leaderboard Integration** | The game must have a leaderboard and leverage the [leaderboard Plugin API](unity-plugin/integration.md#7-leaderboard-access). Example code: [LeaderboardWindowHandler.cs](https://github.com/luxodd/example-game-arcade-shooter/blob/main/ShipBattleGameExample/Assets/Scripts/Game/UI/Handlers/LeaderboardWindowHandler.cs) and [LeaderboardWindowView.cs](https://github.com/luxodd/example-game-arcade-shooter/blob/main/ShipBattleGameExample/Assets/Scripts/Game/UI/Views/LeaderboardWindowView.cs) |
| 6   | **Reconnection Handling**   | The game must handle reconnection scenarios. If a timeout or disconnection occurs, the game should automatically attempt to reconnect the player                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

:::note WebSocket Duration Requirement
The WebSocket connection with the server is required to remain active for 5 minutes, as per our requirements. The game should comply with this session duration and properly manage connection lifecycles.

## 3\. Game Flow and UX

| No. | Requirement                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :-- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Game End Callback             | On game completion, must use the command WebSocketService.BackToSystem()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2   | State Restoration (if used)   | The game must be able to load and resume from user state if saved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3   | Arcade Joystick Support       | All game menus and gameplay must be navigable via a joystick only. Joystick control mapping needs to be intuitive to the player (up is up, down is downâ€¦etc) unless this is used to make the game play harder and is obvious to the player as to why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 4   | Timeout Handling              | All menus must include countdown timers to auto-return to the arcade menu (max 30 seconds)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5   | Start Trigger Limit           | Max time to wait for input before game force-starts: 1 minute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6   | Functional UI Elements        | Every button in the game should be fully functional and have a clear, meaningful purpose. The user interface should be intuitive, with each interactive element supporting the intended player actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 7   | **Non-Session Based Scoring** | Add non-session based points system requirement to games. Examples: levels will max out points that the user can achieve, but it is not accumulative across prior sessions, it simply replaces the points for that level. If time based then the user simply is given their last or max score for the time they played every session (not cumulative)                                                                                                                                             |
| 8   | **Finite Play**               | The game cannot run forever, ideally every session should last at most 10 minutes or less. This means that it needs to be hard enough to die (for a standard player) or finish the game in under 10 mins. (example: have "lives" for players after death, time box the play to less than 10 mins, make level accomplishment easy enough for a standard play to finish the entire game session within 10 mins.
