# Introduction

## Purpose of the Document

Describe the system, its requirements, game specifications, and the necessary steps to integrate a game into our P2P arcade..

## System Overview

The Luxodd Games arcade system hosts webgl games on a local client for paying players. The arcade leverages a web interface which pulls down hosted webgl games.

A backend api gives access to a player's profile based on a session token. Games given a session token are granted access to the customer's account.

This enables developers to host their own infrastructure for a game.
